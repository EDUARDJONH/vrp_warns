Hello, and thanks for purchasing my script :)

For any problems syn#0070 on discord or discord.gg/vrpscripting

Heres some things you should know:

1. The scripts server.lua and config.lua its encrypted, so you can't leak it

2. Even tho the main files are encrypted, you can still FULLY modify the script from the config.lua file (notifications, command names, max warns, etc..) everything is fully customizable

How to install the scripts.

1. Drag vrp_warns into your [resources] folder

2. put the following phrase in your server.cfg: start vrp_warns

3. Run the SQL code from warns.sql in your database, or simply import the FILE.

4. Change Config.Databse to your database dependencie connector, otherwise the script WILL NOT work.

5. Edit config.lua Config.AdminGroups to set your admin groups allowed to use the command

6. It should all work now!
